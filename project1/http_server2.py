# [x] Create a TCP socket on which to listen for new connections
# [x] Bind that socket to the port provided on the command line
# [x] Listen on that socket, which we shall call the "accept socket"
# [x] Initialize the list of open connections to empty
#
# Do the following repeatedly:
# [x] a. Make a list of the sockets we are waiting to read from the list of open connections. We shall call this the "read list." In our case, it's simply the list of all open connections.
#
# [x] b. Add the accept socket to the read list. Having a new connection arrive on this socket makes it available for reading; itâ€™s just that we use a strange kind of read, the accept call, to do the read.
#
# [x] c. Call select with the read list. Your program will now block until one of the sockets on the read list is ready to be read.
#
# [x] d. For each socket on the read list that select has marked readable, do the following:
# [x]    i. If it is the accept socket, accept the new connection and add it to the list of open connections with the appropriate state
# [x]    ii. If it is some other socket, perform steps 4.b through 4.f from the description of http_server1 in Part 2. After closing the socket, delete it from the list of open connections.
#
# [x] Test your server using telnet and curl (or a web browser) as described above, to see whether it really handles two simultaneous connections.
#
# [] Your server should also be robust. If a request is empty or does not start with "GET", your server should just ignore it.
